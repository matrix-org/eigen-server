# The client-server API is not in scope for Linearized Matrix

This CS API exists to show what an "existing messenger" *could* look like and is not representative of
a real client. It uses websockets for ease of use.

The idea behind Linearized Matrix is that you can bring your own CS API, so long as you use Matrix's
content format in that client. How you get that blob to the server is up to you :)
